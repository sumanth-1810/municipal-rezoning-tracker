        Executive Summary: Strategic Growth Corridors
        
        The City of Charlotte continues to encourage development along key transit corridors
        to align with regional mobility goals. The following strategic corridor areas have been
        identified for transformation over the next 15 years:
        
        North Tryon Street Corridor: The area along North Tryon Street from uptown to
        University City represents a critical transit-oriented development opportunity. 
        The city will promote mixed-use development with higher density residential options
        adjacent to LYNX Blue Line stations. Within 24 months, staff will evaluate appropriate
        zoning designations to encourage development that supports walkable, transit-rich communities.
        Infrastructure investments including sewer expansion and sidewalk improvements are 
        scheduled for 2025-2026.
        
        West Trade Street Corridor: Recent private investment signals strong market interest
        in the West Trade Street area between downtown and the airport. The city will consider
        rezoning to allow mixed-use development with ground-floor retail and upper-story residential.
        This redevelopment opportunity aligns with our Airport Economic Development Strategy.
        
        South Boulevard Corridor: As a proven success story, South Boulevard demonstrates the
        potential for transit-oriented growth. The city will extend similar TOD principles to
        adjacent parallel corridors including South Tryon Street and Clanton Road. Future growth
        in these areas should include affordable housing components and neighborhood-serving retail.
        
        Eastway Drive Corridor: A long-term priority area, Eastway Drive from Central Avenue
        to Albemarle Road has been identified for potential corridor improvements and strategic
        land use changes. This area is appropriate for moderate-density residential development
        and neighborhood commercial uses.
        
        The planning department will conduct community engagement sessions in Q1 2025 to refine
        these corridor strategies before formal UDO amendments are proposed.

        UDO Amendment Summary
        
        Amendment A: Transit-Oriented Development Overlay Expansion
        
        Staff recommends expanding the TOD-M (Transit-Oriented Development - Mixed Use) overlay
        to include properties within 1/2 mile of planned Bus Rapid Transit stations along
        Independence Boulevard. This strategic corridor has seen significant infrastructure investment
        and is ripe for transformation from auto-oriented commercial to walkable mixed-use development.
        
        The Independence Boulevard corridor between downtown and Matthews has been studied extensively
        and shows strong redevelopment potential. Current zoning does not reflect the city's vision
        for this priority area. Immediate action is recommended to encourage development before
        land values escalate further.
        
        Amendment B: West Morehead Street Zoning Study
        
        The West Morehead Street area from I-77 to Freedom Drive will undergo a comprehensive
        master plan update beginning in January 2025. This study will evaluate opportunities for
        increased density and mixed-use development given the corridor's proximity to uptown and
        excellent highway access. Property owners have expressed interest in potential rezoning
        to allow mid-rise residential development.
        
        Amendment C: NoDa District Boundary Expansion
        
        Responding to market demand and consistent with our arts district strategy, staff proposes
        extending NoDa zoning provisions to include properties along 36th Street from North Davidson
        to North Tryon Street. This would promote mixed-use development with arts/creative space
        requirements and encourage the district's organic growth northward.

        November 2024 Strategic Planning Session - Key Initiatives
        
        Infrastructure Investment Priorities (2025-2027)
        
        Council directed staff to prioritize water and sewer infrastructure improvements in the
        following areas to support anticipated growth:
        
        1. Beatties Ford Road Corridor - Sewer capacity expansion from I-85 to Mt Holly Road
           Timeline: Design in 2025, construction 2026
           Rationale: Remove infrastructure constraints for redevelopment opportunities
        
        2. Plaza Road Extension Area - New sewer trunk line installation
           Timeline: Within 18 months
           Impact: Opens 300+ acres for development that currently lack adequate infrastructure
        
        3. North Graham Street between 27th and 36th Streets
           Water main replacement and upsizing to support mixed-use development
           Near-term priority given market interest from developers
        
        Economic Development Corridors
        
        The Economic Development Committee highlighted the need to transform legacy industrial
        corridors into modern employment centers. Specific focus areas include:
        
        Wilkinson Boulevard: From I-77 to Tuckaseegee Road, this corridor represents a significant
        redevelopment opportunity. Council supported exploring appropriate zoning that would allow
        modern industrial, flex space, and supporting residential uses. This transformation is
        essential for maintaining Charlotte's competitive position in attracting advanced manufacturing.
        
        Statesville Road Corridor: The area near the former Eastland Mall site and along Statesville
        Road to I-85 should be evaluated for comprehensive rezoning. Current B-2 zoning is outdated
        and does not reflect the area's potential for mixed-use redevelopment. Staff will present
        options in Q2 2025.
        
        Affordable Housing Strategy
        
        Council emphasized the importance of proactive rezoning to increase housing supply. The
        following areas were identified for potential missing middle housing initiatives:
        
        - Neighborhoods adjacent to Central Avenue (along established transit corridor)
        - Areas surrounding future Silver Line stations in eastern Charlotte
        - Corridors identified in the 2040 Plan as Community Activity Centers
        
        Staff will return with specific policy recommendations by March 2025.

        Item 5: Area Plan Updates - Staff Presentation
        
        Central Avenue Vision Plan Refresh
        
        Staff presented updates to the Central Avenue Vision Plan, originally adopted in 2017.
        The corridor from uptown to Eastway Drive continues to see strong development interest.
        Key recommendations include:
        
        - Extend TOD zoning principles to side streets and parallel corridors (Pecan Avenue,
          The Plaza) to capture spillover development demand
        - Encourage development along Briar Creek from Central Avenue to Sharon Amity Road
        - Support transformation of aging retail centers into mixed-use projects
        
        Commissioner feedback emphasized the need for immediate rezoning along The Plaza between
        Central and Eastway to prevent incompatible development and capture near-term opportunities.
        
        Item 7: Mobility Investment Updates
        
        Transportation Planning staff updated the commission on planned investments that will
        impact land use patterns:
        
        Scaleybark Road Improvements: Road widening and complete streets implementation from
        South Boulevard to Park Road. Construction begins 2025. This investment creates
        opportunities for corridor development between two successful transit-oriented areas.
        
        Sugar Creek Road Study: NCDOT and city are studying potential Bus Rapid Transit on
        Sugar Creek Road from uptown to Derita. If approved, this would unlock significant
        development potential along the corridor. Preliminary engineering in 2025, with potential
        service by 2028.
        
        Monroe Road Corridor: The section from Wendover Road to Matthews is being evaluated
        for road diet and mixed-use development potential. Current zoning does not align with
        the city's vision for this area as a walkable urban corridor. UDO amendments are
        anticipated by summer 2025.

        2024 Planning Highlights and 2025 Priorities
        
        Emerging Development Patterns
        
        This year saw unprecedented interest in formerly overlooked corridors. Several trends
        emerged that will shape our 2025 work program:
        
        Airport Corridor Transformation: The area along Billy Graham Parkway and surrounding
        neighborhoods is experiencing renewed interest. Multiple developers have inquired about
        rezoning opportunities. Staff recommends a comprehensive area study to establish a
        cohesive vision before individual petitions create piecemeal development patterns.
        
        Eastland Area Reimagining: Following demolition of the mall, the broader Eastland area
        (bounded by Central Avenue, Albemarle Road, and Eastway Drive) represents Charlotte's
        most significant urban redevelopment opportunity. The city will lead a master planning
        process in 2025, with expected UDO changes to follow. This is a priority area for
        city-initiated rezoning to ensure coordinated development.
        
        Hidden Valley/Newell Area: An underutilized area near I-85 and North Tryon showing early
        signs of market interest. Infrastructure constraints (sewer capacity) have historically
        limited development. With planned sewer improvements in 2025-2026, this corridor is
        positioned for transformation. Staff will monitor market signals and evaluate appropriate
        future land uses.
        
        South End Expansion: Success of South End is driving development interest in adjacent
        areas including Remount Road, Clanton Road, and the Scaleybark neighborhood. These
        corridors are natural extensions of the South End growth pattern and should be evaluated
        for complementary zoning that supports walkable mixed-use development.
        
        2025 Strategic Initiatives
        
        1. Proactive Corridor Rezoning Program
           Rather than waiting for developer petitions, the city will identify 3-5 strategic
           corridors for city-initiated comprehensive rezoning. This approach allows us to
           shape development patterns and ensure public benefit.
           
        2. Infrastructure-Led Development
           Coordinate capital improvement programming with land use planning to sequence
           infrastructure investments ahead of development pressure in priority growth areas.
           
        3. Missing Middle Housing Policy
           Develop zoning tools to enable diverse housing types in neighborhoods near transit
           and employment centers. Focus areas include corridors identified in the 2040 Plan.
